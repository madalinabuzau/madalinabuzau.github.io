I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Seville. My research is focused on developing supervised machine learning algorithms for non-technical losses detection in power utilities. I like experimenting with all types of machine learning models (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement) so I thought it would be nice to share my experiments here on this blog.
